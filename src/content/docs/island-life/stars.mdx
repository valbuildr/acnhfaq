## When will I see meteor showers?
Meteor showers are dependent on your [weather seed](#what-determines-the-weather-on-my-island). On nights with certain clear weather patterns, you may see shooting stars between 7:00 PM and 4:00 AM. There are two types of star showers:
- **Heavy meteor showers:** Usually announced by Isabelle <ExternalIcon icon="sza" category="NpcIcon" />. Villagers will mention it/talk about it if you talk to them. Heavy showers will bring groups of 5-8 shooting stars roughly every minute or so. These are rare, only occurring on average about 10 times per year. 
- **Light meteor showers:** On light shower nights, you will see only a handful of shooting stars each hour. These are more common, occurring on average 5-10 nights per month.

<Aside type="caution">
  If she has anything else to announce for the day, like a villager moving in or out or a camper visiting, Isabelle <ExternalIcon icon="sza" category="NpcIcon" /> will **not** announce a heavy meteor shower if one is to happen that day.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  Both heavy and light meteor showers are locked to the date on which they occur, and will always occur on that date even if you time travel.

## How do I wish on a star, and what does it do?
To wish on a star: when you see or hear it moving across the sky, stand still, look up with <ButtonIcon button="R-S" />, and press the <ButtonIcon button="A" /> button. Make sure you are not holding any tools or other items in your hands. You'll know that it worked if you hear a tone and see the star glow a little brighter. For each star you wish on, you will find a star fragment on your beach the following day. Watch the following video for a demonstration, courtesy of `Nours#7244`.

Star fragments are a crafting material that can be used in <ExternalIcon icon="PaperRecipe" category="MenuIcon" /> DIY recipes.

## What's the max amount of star fragments I can get?
1 wish = 1 star fragment. You can also visit other players who have shooting stars and wish on their islands; wishes made on someone else's island will count as personal wishes.

By yourself, you can obtain a maximum of 20 star fragments. If you invite visitors from other islands (**not** other residents that live on your island), you can obtain up to 40 star fragments. For every 5 wishes your visitors make, you will receive 1 additional star fragment on top of the amount you wished for yourself. This means your visitors need to wish 100 times total for you to achieve the additional 20, for a max total of 40 fragments.

## Can I visit other islands for meteor showers and/or Celeste?
Yes! You can wish on shooting stars while visiting another player's island and the star fragments will appear on your island's beach the next day. Just like on your own island, each wish you make on another island counts for one star fragment, to a maximum of 20 wishes. Any zodiac fragments you receive will correspond to the date on your island and not the date of the host island. By extension if you had wished on stars on the last zodiac day on your island (or someone else's island), the star fragments you find on the beach the next day will be from the zodiac corresponding to the day you wished.

However, if you visit Celeste <ExternalIcon icon="ows" category="NpcIcon" /> on another player's island, any zodiac DIY you receive will correspond to the date of the host island.  

## I didn't get all my star fragments the next day! What gives?
Star fragments spawn periodically throughout the day, usually 8-10 at a time. If the next set doesn't appear after a little while, clear your beaches of shells and other items that may block the spawns and wait a little while longer.
