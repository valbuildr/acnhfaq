Harvey's Island is a separate island accessible by using Dodo Airlines. The island serves two functions: as a photo studio and as a commune for permanent co-op shops to be set up by various NPCs. It also serves as the location for the June wedding event.

## Photopia
Photopia is a photography studio where you can set up customised sets for photo opportunities. The furniture used to decorate here is based on your catalogue. Scanning amiibo here will also unlock that character's poster that will be available for order in Nook Shopping. 

## The Commune
The Commune is a new expansion introduced in version `2.0.0` which allows the player to set-up co-op shops of both existing, and new NPC vendors. To unlock the expansion:
- K.K. Slider must have performed
- You must have entered Photopia
- You must have talked to Harv on his island

### What are the co-ops available on The Commune?
There are 7 co-ops available to unlock. Each co-op requires a donation of 100,000 <ButtonIcon button="Bells" />, paid to the respective Lloid on the designated spot, and only one co-op may be funded per day. The table below details what each co-op is and its purpose, clockwise starting from the first co-op on the left.

### Will the NPCs with co-ops stop visiting my island?
No, they will still visit your island as per the usual NPC schedule. If they do visit your island, their co-op will be closed for the day at the commune. 

### When will the wares at the co-ops refresh?
The inventory of all co-ops refreshes weekly, on Monday. An exception to this is Redd, who will also replace art bought the previous day with another random art piece.

### How do I unlock the ABD at Harvey's Island?
The ABD machine will be installed automatically once you set-up the first co-op.

### What does Harriet do?
Harriet offers one new hairstyle per co-op unlocked. You can only obtain one new hairstyle per day. Her opening times are from 5am - 10pm. Note that she will stay open if you arrive within her opening times, unless you leave the map (i.e. going to Photopia).

# Katrina's Fortunes
Here are some more commonly asked questions about Katrina and her Fortune system.

## When does the daily fortune apply?
Katrina's fortune is only applied when you speak to her and ask about the daily fortune. If you have not spoken to her for the day, no daily fortune is set.

## What do I get for the cleansing ritual?
In the event that you received a bad fortune, Katrina will offer you a cleansing service for 10,000 <ButtonIcon button="Bells" />. This will make it so the daily fortune is not set, and you will receive an item in the mail the next day. The items that she can give you via this service are:

1. <ExternalIcon icon="FtrGoldTurtle" category="FtrIcon" /> Gold turtle figurine
2. <ExternalIcon icon="FtrDoorOrnamentHorseshoe" category="FtrIcon" /> Horseshoe door decoration
3. <ExternalIcon icon="FtrDharmaS_Remake_0_0" category="FtrIcon" /> Mini dharma
4. <ExternalIcon icon="FtrPowerstone" category="FtrIcon" /> Power stone

<Aside type="note">
  As of `2.0.4`, Katrina has a 20% chance to instead give you a [New Year zodiac figurine](https://catalogue.ac/?s=bmFtZT16b2RpYWM7bG9jPWVuLXVz) based on the year (or a random one if you've catalogued the current year's zodiac animal) for doing her cleansing service.

## What does divining friendship do?
This allows you to gauge at what level your friendship is with a villager. Katrina may also ask if you wish to bless the friendship with 10,000 <ButtonIcon button="Bells" />. This will add +2 friendship points whenever the option is available. The various phrases that she uses reflects your current friendship level, which is tabled below. It should be noted that you cannot bless the friendship once you have reached friendship level 5.

| 5                    | I see many faces before me… You smile… You frown…                                  |
| 6                    | I see many faces before me… You smile… You frown…                                  |
