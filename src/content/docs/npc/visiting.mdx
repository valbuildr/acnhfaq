Visiting NPCs, as the name suggests, visits your island. These NPCs have a visiting schedule dictated by who has appeared the week before, and usually only one visiting NPC will be present on your island at any given day. Some of them will wander your island, and some of them will hang out at the plaza. 

## How often does a visiting NPC visit?

Visiting NPCs are on a set **bi-weekly** schedule, and each rotating NPC can only visit a maximum of once per week. In short, you should see a particular visiting NPC at least once every two weeks. 

Refer to Yue's guide here for a compressed version of the information on this page: https://yuexr.github.io/img/npcskd.png
